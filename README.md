## Pre-Project Expectations
This is my first attempt at using Ruby on Rails for application development. As this project follows a walkthrough my expectations are to simply become familiar with the organization of a Rails project as well as becoming familiar with the DSL itself. I look forward to becoming more familiar with the MVC project structure as well as learning the workflow of a rails project.

##Post-Project
Top take-aways from this project  
1. The DSL syntax as a whole.  
2. Using MVC structure for a project.  
3. Utilizing gems (ex. sorcery, paperclip).  
4. Working with migration files.  
5. Using DRY and RESTful practices.
